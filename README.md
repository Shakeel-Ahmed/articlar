### **NOTE**: 

This is my pet project I started in 2016 I worked on it as much as my spare time allowed me and I didn't find any after 2018. The project is in pause since then. But It is a fully functional application and I did a complete user guide on it which I uploaded earlier but unfortunately, I lost the server. I will reupload and put the link here soon.

At its core running a customized CI4-based framework for fast performance.
